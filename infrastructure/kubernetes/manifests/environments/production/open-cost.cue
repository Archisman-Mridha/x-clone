// OpenCost is a vendor-neutral open source project for measuring and allocating cloud
// infrastructure and container costs. Itâ€™s built for Kubernetes cost monitoring to power real-time
// cost monitoring, showback, and chargeback.
//
// OpenCost will automatically read the node information node.spec.providerID to determine the
// cloud service provider (CSP) in use. If it detects the CSP is AWS, it will attempt to pull the
// AWS on-demand pricing from the configured public API URL with no further configuration required.
